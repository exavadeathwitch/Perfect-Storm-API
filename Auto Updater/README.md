# Files For The Perfect Storm Updater

These files should be complied into an exe to use them.  Install Python 3.8 or greater and then install all the bundles included in requirements.txt.
Point auto-py-to-exe to main.py and let it do it's job. (Optional: Include an ico file for your icon. One is bundled.)
From there, just bundle the 7zip command line tool with the files and you're set.
To make bundling easier you can download and install NSIS.
