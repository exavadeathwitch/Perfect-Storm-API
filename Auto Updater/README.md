These files should be complied into an exe to use them.  Install Python and then pip install auto-py-to-exe.
Point auto-py-to-exe to main.py and let it do it's job. From there just bundle the 7zip command line tool with the files and you're set.
To make bundling easier you can download and install NSIS.
